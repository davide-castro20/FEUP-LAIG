## Project information ##

- The XML parser detects and flags a wide array of errors. Examples: startCell and endCell cannot be in invalid indexes in the spritesheet. Characters outside the fonts cannot be drawn
- There isn't any problem if there are multiple keyframes or sprite changes from a spritesheet between update calls
- The scene is complex and every new primitive is used (plane, patch, barrel and spritesheet animations/text)
- Detailed keyframe animations are used in the scene to create more movement, using translation, rotation and scale
----
## Issues/Problems ##

-The parser does not assume default values to continue rendering in some cases.
